description: Two simple projects with nodejs
---

On days 7 and 8, I learned basic Express.js by creating two simple apps.

The first app is a basic website with simple routing. You can see source code at [github repository](https://github.com/rafalmoneta/basic-site-express). Also on day 7, I spend some time reading about Web Architecture, Client-Server Architecture and different tiers in software architecture.

The second project is a simple message board created with Expressjs. Source code at [Github](https://github.com/rafalmoneta/mini-message-board). I deployed this app to Heroku and you can see a live demo [here](https://safe-bastion-00302.herokuapp.com/).
