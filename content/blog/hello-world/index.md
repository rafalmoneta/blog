**Hello, world!** üåç 

My name is Rafa≈Ç Moneta and this is my programming blog. I am a college student at the Cracow University of Economics who does some coding in my free time. I am a huge fan of 'Chuck' TV series, football and running. My goal is to change the world by creating useful applications and teaching kids programming.

I created this blog for the purpose of the #100daysOfCoding challenge. I hope to write every day about my progress, what  I have learned and on what projects did I work. Besides that, I want to try to write some technical/tutorials post and improve my English and writing skills.
If you are too lazy to read my blog post about my coding journey thought #100daysOfCode you can always visit my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rmoneta5) for a shorter version. 

Wish me luck and I see you around. ü§ì

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World! My name is ...")
}
```
